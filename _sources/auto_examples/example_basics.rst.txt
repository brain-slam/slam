This script shows examples of basic functionalities offered by SLAM.
Some (most) of these are actually inherited from Trimesh
This script does not plot anything, see example_plot.py for that purpose

mesh_file = 'data/example_mesh.gii'
# loading a mesh stored on the disc as a gifti file,
# this is a feature of SLAM
mesh = sio.load_mesh(mesh_file)

# affine transformations can be applied to mesh objects
mesh.apply_transform(mesh.principal_inertia_transform)
# laplacian smoothing is available in Trimesh
# mesh_s = sm.filter_laplacian(mesh, iterations=20)

mesh.fill_holes() is able to fill missing face but do not handle
larger holes, see example_topology for that purpose

interesting properties / functions of a mesh
see base.py for more details
what's the euler number for the mesh?
print('mesh.euler_number=', mesh.euler_number)

access mesh edges
mesh.edges

access mesh faces
mesh.faces

access mesh vertice
mesh.vertices
# access mesh edges
mesh.edges

what's the area of the mesh
 print('mesh.area=', mesh.area)

###############################################################################
 compute the area of each face
 mesh.area_faces

access mesh faces angles
mesh.face_angles

access mesh volume
mesh.volume

get the face_normal of the mesh
mesh.face_normals

get the vertex_normals of the mesh
mesh.vertex_normals

access mesh vertex connectivity
mesh.vertex_neighbors

compute mesh convex hull
c_h_mesh = mesh.convex_hull

kdtree of the vertices
see example_kdtree.py

mesh refinement by subdivision of face
mesh.subdivide()

extract 100 mesh vertices picked at random
mesh.sample(100)

voxelize the mesh
mesh.voxelized(2)

boundary of the mesh or list of faces
mesh.outline()

the convex hull is another Trimesh object that is available as a property
lets compare the volume of our mesh with the volume of its convex hull
np.divide(mesh.volume, mesh.convex_hull.volume)

since the mesh is watertight, it means there is a
volumetric center of mass which we can set as the origin for our mesh
mesh.vertices -= mesh.center_mass

what's the moment of inertia for the mesh?
mesh.moment_inertia

if there are multiple bodies in the mesh we can split the mesh by
connected components of face adjacency
since this example mesh is a single watertight body we get a list of one
mesh
mesh.split()

find groups of coplanar adjacent faces
facets, facets_area = mesh.facets(return_area=True)

transform method can be passed a (4,4) matrix and will cleanly apply the
transform
mesh.apply_transform(trimesh.transformations.random_rotation_matrix())

axis aligned bounding box is available
mesh.bounding_box.extents

a minimum volume oriented bounding box also available
primitives are subclasses of Trimesh objects which automatically generate
faces and vertices from data stored in the 'primitive' attribute
mesh.bounding_box_oriented.primitive.extents
mesh.bounding_box_oriented.primitive.transform

bounding spheres and bounding cylinders of meshes are also
available, and will be the minimum volume version of each
except in certain degenerate cases, where they will be no worse
than a least squares fit version of the primitive.
print(mesh.bounding_box_oriented.volume,
      mesh.bounding_cylinder.volume,
      mesh.bounding_sphere.volume)
